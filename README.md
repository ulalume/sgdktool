SGDKTool is a CLI tool to support development with SGDK (Sega Genesis Development Kit).

---

## 1. Installation

### Install SGDKTool (via cargo)

```sh
cargo install --git https://github.com/ulalume/sgdktool
```

### Required Tools (macOS)

The following tools are required. You can install them with Homebrew:

```sh
brew install make openjdk compiledb

brew tap gcenx/wine
brew install --cask --no-quarantine wine-crossover
```

- `git` is usually pre-installed, but if not, install it with `brew install git`.
- Running `sgdktool` with no command will perform an environment check and show if all required tools are installed.

---

## 2. Usage

Main commands:

- `sgdktool`  
  Show environment check, SGDK/emulator configuration, and help message.  
  If no subcommand is given, displays the current SGDK and emulator setup status.

- `sgdktool setup [--dir <path>] [--branch <branch>]`  
  Download and install SGDK (Sega Genesis Development Kit).  
  You can specify the installation directory with `--dir` (default: config directory), and the branch with `--branch` (default: master).  
  The SGDK path and branch are saved in config.toml.

- `sgdktool setup-emu [gens|blastem] [--dir <path>]`  
  Download and install an emulator (Gens or BlastEm).  
  You can specify the installation directory with `--dir` (default: config directory).  
  The path to the emulator is saved in config.toml.

- `sgdktool new <project_name>`  
  Create a new project from the SGDK template.  
  The project will be created in a new directory named `<project_name>`.

- `sgdktool make [--project <dir>] [<extra options>...]`  
  Build the SGDK project using `make`.  
  You can specify the project directory with `--project` (default: current directory), and pass extra options to `make`.

- `sgdktool run [gens|blastem] [--rom <path>]`  
  Run the ROM file with the specified emulator (default: gens or installed emulator).  
  You can specify the emulator and ROM file path (default: auto-detect/`out/rom.bin`).  
  If the emulator is not installed, a message will prompt you to run setup-emu.

- `sgdktool uninstall [--config-only]`  
  Uninstall SGDK, remove configuration, and also delete any emulators (Gens/BlastEm) installed via `setup-emu` at the paths recorded in config.toml.  
  If `--config-only` is specified, only the configuration file is removed and SGDK itself is kept.

### Simple Example

```sh
sgdktool setup
sgdktool setup-emu
sgdktool new your_project
cd your_project
sgdktool make
sgdktool run
```
